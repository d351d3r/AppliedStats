# AppliedStats
Here I gather my homeworks on Applied Statistics. Later I will add my hw's from Avito Analytics Academy.

## Requirements

You should have a `Scikit-learn` package preinstalled. Also `pandas` is needed. You should launch all the notebooks using `jupyter notebook`.
```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib ipython notebook
```
Other packages install-scripts are in front of the notebooks. 

## Usage
Just install `jupyter notebook` and have fun.

## Roadmap
Here there are two main folders: [MIPT applied stats folder](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks "MIPT") and AVITO.

In the [MIPT folder](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks "here") you can find my homeworks and I have some space for big tests:
* [HW1](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW1) --- basic EDA methods;
* [HW2](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW2) --- parametric hypothesis tests;
* [HW3](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW3) --- non-parametric hypothesis tests;

### Progress
3 homeworks done by far.
