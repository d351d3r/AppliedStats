# AppliedStats
Here I gather my homeworks on Applied Statistics. Later I will add my hw's from Avito Analytics Academy.

## Requirements

You should have a `Scikit-learn` package preinstalled. Also `pandas` is needed. You should launch all the notebooks using `jupyter notebook`.
```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib ipython notebook
```
Other packages install-scripts are in front of the notebooks. 

## Usage
Just install `jupyter notebook` and have fun.

## Roadmap
Here there are two main folders: MIPT and AVITO.

In the MIPT folder you can find my homeworks and I have some space for big tests.

### Progress
3 homeworks done by far.
