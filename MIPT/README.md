# MIPT Applied Stats 
Here I gather my homeworks on Applied Statistics. 

## Requirements

You should have a `Scikit-learn` package preinstalled. Also `pandas` is needed. You should launch all the notebooks using `jupyter notebook`.
```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib ipython notebook
```
Other packages install-scripts are in front of the notebooks. 

## Usage
Just install `jupyter notebook` and have fun.

## Roadmap
Here you can find my homeworks and I have some space left for big tests:
* [HW1](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW1) --- basic EDA methods;
* [HW2](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW2) --- parametric hypothesis tests;
* [HW3](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW3) --- non-parametric hypothesis tests;
* [HW4](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW4) --- multiple hypothesis testing;
* [HW5](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW5) --- correlation analysis;
* [HW6](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW6) --- dispersion analysis;
* [HW7](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW7) --- regression analysis (not done yet);


### Progress
6.5 homeworks done by far.
