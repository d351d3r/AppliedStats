# MIPT Applied Stats 
Here I gather my homeworks on Applied Statistics. 

## Requirements

You should have a `Scikit-learn` package preinstalled. Also `pandas` is needed. You should launch all the notebooks using `jupyter notebook`.
```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib ipython notebook
```
Other packages install-scripts are in front of the notebooks. 

## Usage
Just install `jupyter notebook` and have fun.

## Roadmap
Here you can find my homeworks and labs:

Homeworks:
* [HW1](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW1) — basic EDA methods;
* [HW2](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW2) — parametric hypothesis tests;
* [HW3](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW3) — non-parametric hypothesis tests;
* [HW4](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW4) — multiple hypothesis testing;
* [HW5](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW5) — correlation analysis;
* [HW6](https://github.com/yk4r2/AppliedStats/tree/main/MIPT/homeworks/HW6) — dispersion analysis;
